🚀 What I'm Up To:

Currently leading the development of NachoApps, a dynamic startup focused on crafting beautiful, fast, and slick cross-platform apps and mobile games. Our flagship project is an immersive cross-platform mobile game set in New York City. It’s a real-life adventure game where players explore the city, engage in real estate transactions, collect artifacts, and undertake quests at specific locations.

Previously engineered a cutting-edge Image Classifier app that recognizes various models of shoes and sneakers 👟 using TensorFlow and Flutter for a seamless cross-platform experience.

⚙️ My GitHub Portfolio:

Actively maintaining a portfolio on GitHub that showcases both ongoing and past projects, highlighting my technical skills and innovative problem-solving capabilities.
📚 Continuous Learning:

Deepening my expertise in TensorFlow for Machine Learning, Python for Data Science, and Flutter for robust cross-platform application development across iOS, Android, macOS, Web, Linux, and Windows Desktop.
🤝 Collaborations and Partnerships:

Keen on forging partnerships and seeking collaborative opportunities that enhance Flutter applications. Particularly interested in ventures that cater to the North American market.
🌍 Exciting Ventures Ahead:

Launching a crowdfunding campaign in May aimed at hiring talented artists and funding an advertising campaign to propel our mobile game project.
